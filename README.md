This is a repo that is a collection of research datasets for African American fine artists throughout history

##Rationale
Art is a fundamental expression of human culture, yet historically, the contributions of African American fine artists have often been underrepresented in academic research, public collections, and digital archives. By creating a repository dedicated to research datasets of African American fine artists, this project seeks to address this gap and make these important contributions more accessible to researchers, educators, and the public.
